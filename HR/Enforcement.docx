What actually is Enforcement ?
The general meaning of the term is to implement something or compelling with the law or rules. In this context also it means the same . The GRC Department defined a no. Of norms to regulate the interns and to maintain the Company's internal ethics. 
Now, its the duty of the HR Department to actually make it work. This is why it is said that the GRC & HR go hand in hand with other. The HR Department  has to make plans to make this happen in real. The HR Department has to plan how exactly they can carry out the operations such that they can make the employees comply with the Company's policies. Also the HR Department has to take corrective actiona in case an employee exploits the company rules.

Why an Organization needs to Enforce the Policies ?
An Organization/Company is a place where a no. of people or professionally called as Employees come together under a common roof to work for their teams and ultimately the organization. When such a volume of people come together, it is common to have some people who create nuisance and exploit the social as well as professional ethics. People may create mental stress among their colleagues by mocking them or in other ways. 
Also some of the employees may also disrupt the company's overall production by not giving the contribution, taking unwanted leaves, not doing quality work, etc. Therefore, there is a serious need for a company to have a set of rules for the employees to follow and a group of people to actually monitor the employees to see whether they stick to the policies or not. Also a company needs to plan about the penalties for different levels of exploitation . This will help to control the employees by and prevent them from creating any problems which will account for streamlined flow in Company's overall production and profits.
